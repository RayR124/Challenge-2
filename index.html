                    <h1>A little about Me:</h1>
                    <p>
                        I am first and foremost a father to 3 amazing children. Being a father is the only job I take
                        more seriously than being a husband. My family if my life, and it is this mentality that pushes
                        me to be better every day. I do it for them. When I am not partaking in one of my many
                        responsibilites I like to spend my free time designing in any which way my brain prefers at any
                        given moment. Sometimes that may mean coding, other times it may mean designing new cards for a
                        game I'm working on. And other days it may mean drafting a story for the world and background of
                        one of my games.
                         
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have yet to publish any of my games, but I feel I am getting close with at least a couple of
                        my many, MANY projects I have working. I am particularly proud of my game called "Vex" which I
                        hope hits the market in some way, shape, or form by next year.
                         
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I thoroughly enjoy puzzle solving and working on my board and card games gives me many creative
                        outlets to solve puzzles, and find unique and enjoyable solutions to problems that rise up
                        during almost every play-testing session. These are not, however, set backs. Every opportunity
                        for growth makes my game that much better, and that much closer to being "ready" for the
                        public... Sadly, however, my constant need to drive for perfection will always result in finding
                        another flaw, and finding another solution.
                         
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One day, the world will be introduced to Raze Games. And for all my doubts, that day can not
                        come soon enough!
